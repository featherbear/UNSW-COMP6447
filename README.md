# System and Software Security Assessment
2020 Session Two Course Work

---

Hi there! If you can see this message, you've reached the repository containing the stuff I've done in this course!

You'll probably find that the most useful thing here is the [blog site for this course](https://featherbear.cc/UNSW-COMP6447/), where all my notes are!

Otherwise, the `labs`, `midsem` and `wargames` directories might be useful...

Also, if you wanted a script to launch _pwndocker_, have a look at the `startPwnDocker.sh` script!
